Difference between Class based and Function based Components

Class Based Component                                              Functional based Component
--------------------------------------------------                ---------------------------------

1. uses class which extends from react component, its render              1. JS Pure function to accept props and return JSX elements.
method must return JSX elements.
2. Statefull component.                                                   2. Sateless component
3. It requires render method to return JSX.                               3. No need to use render method.
4. Constructor used to initialize state.                                  4. No need to use constructor. 
5. uses Lifecycle Methods in component.                                   5.  5. No lifecycle methods are available.
6. Component is alive depending on lifecycle                              6. It executes from top to bottom, once it returns JSX it is not alive.
7. No hooks are used.                                                     7. Hooks used to provide React features.

React Features
---------------

- React State : used to store value in a component, is an object, whenever state changes component will re-render, to change the state use setState(value)


- React Component Life Cycle Methods
1) Mounting phase : putting JSX into DOM
        - constructor()
        - getDerivedStateFromProps()
        - render() (putting JSX into DOM)
        -componentDidMount()
2) Updating phase : when component is updating
        - getDerivedStateFromProps()
        - shouldComponentUpdate() returns boolean value
        - render()
        - getSnapShotBeforeUpdate()
        - componentDidUpdate()
3) Unmounting phase : removal of a component from DOM 
        - componentWillUnmount()


React Hooks
------------
- Hooks are used to allow functional components to have React Features.
- Predefined functions in react.
- to use a hook in functional component, it needs to be called.

        Rules to call a Hook
        ---------------------
            1. import hook from react component.
            2. Hooks can be called at the top level of a component.
            3. Hooks cannot be conditional.

- Two types of Hooks
    1) Predefined Hooks
        -useState Hook : used to create state in functional component.
        syntax: const [stateName,setStateName] =  useState(initialValue)
        - useEffect Hook : used to provide side effects to the component
        syntax: useEffect(callback,dependency(optional))
          -callback : used to provide effects using function.
          - dependency: decide when side effects applied to the component
           1) No dependency: side effects will be applied everytime to the component.
           2) empty array [] : side effects will be applied only at the time of component creation.
           3) [state,props,variable] : side effects will be applied at the time of component creation and changing of state/props/variable that is used in the dependency.

    2) Customized Hooks
        - create a js file with filename that starts with "use"
        - inside the file, define a function with name same as the filename.

- Handling Forms in React : how it handles data when it changes also when it submitted.
 -  in react, form data must be handled by react component. to store data, it has to use state.
 - while submitting the form,use preventDefault() to avoid unnecessary refreshiong of the page.
 - categorize component depending on how data is managed by component in Forms.
   1) Controlled component : data stored in component state.
   2) Unconctrolled component: data used by html references.(useRef hook is used)
